    <h1>Meadow Runner</h1>
    <p>Meadow Runner is an endless runner style game, in which you must guide your sheep to run for as long as possible, avoiding as many obsticles as you can. The longer you go, the higher your score!</p>
    <p>As you dash along, you will hurtle towards cows. Use your left and right arrow keys to avoid them. Be aware, though, the area of play is only 5 lanes wide. You do not have infinite space.</p>
    <p>For now, when you lose (and you will), hit F5 to refresh. Such trivialities as a reset button weren't as exciting as making the game</p>
    <p id="app-description">Use tab to move onto the main app element to pass control over to the application. When you are ready, hit enter to begin.</p>
